First let's go to the page:
![Page view][p3]
If the address is correct, then we should see something like this:
![Page view][p1]
After clicking Advanced... -> Accept the Risk and Continue we finally land on what seems a real login page:
![Login page][p2]
Ok, now it's time to search for the host name, so we proceed by clicking the i button in address bar:
![Address bar][p3]
Moving on, we click the right arrow on the connection tab:
![Menu][p4]
Next we click the `More information` button on the bottom:
![Menu][p5]
This is the security tab, which will lead us to the certificate:
![Security][p6]
What we see now is the information about page's security certificate, its issuer and who is it issued to. What is standing out is the name `source`, so I assume it's our hostname. We can see it here:
![Source][p7]
or here:
![Source][p8]
